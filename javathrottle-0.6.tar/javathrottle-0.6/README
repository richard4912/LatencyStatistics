To compile:

ant

To use:

... | java -jar javathrottle.jar | ...

Notes:
  The program is (so far) built on the assumption that it is a
  bottleneck, ie, at any given time there is data waiting to be read.
  When this is not true, strange things can happen, mainly gui
  lockups.  This will be remedied in a future (nio) version.

  Requires java 1.2.
